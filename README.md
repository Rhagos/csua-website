# CSUA Website

Featuring the horrors of Node.js

## Maintainer Guide

- Go to https://www.csua.berkeley.edu:8080/admin/ to edit
  officer/sponsor/pb/event data!
- Only a few things left to update in `./static/data`

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Getting Started

- Navigate to where you want to clone the website. Clone it, get into it, make a new branch, make changes, push that branch, and create a pull request for that branch. For example,
  - `git clone https://github.com/CSUA/csua-website`: clone the website
  - `cd csua-website`
  - `git checkout -B "${BRANCH_NAME}"`: creates a new branch and checks it out (switches to it)
  - Make changes and commit them, e.g
    - `touch documentation`
    - `git add documentation`
    - `git commit -m "I added documentation."`
    - or any other series of changes
  - `git push --set-upstream origin ${BRANCH_NAME}`: if you try pushing without setting upstream, it'll tell you do git gud and do this
  - now create a pull request (PR) from your branch to master on Github

## Developer Guide (Frontend)

## Contribution Process

- Navigate to where you want to clone the website. Clone it, get into it, make a
  new branch, make changes, push that branch, and create a pull request for that
  branch. For example,
  - `git clone https://github.com/CSUA/csua-website` clones the website to  your
    local machine
  - `cd csua-website` to navigate to the project directory
  - `git checkout -B BRANCH_NAME`: creates a new branch named BRANCH_NAME and
    checks it out (switches to it)
    - Choose a branch name like `dev-caleb` or the name of the feature you are
      working on
  - Make changes and commit them, e.g.
    - `touch documentation.txt`
    - `git add documentation.txt`
    - `git commit -m "I added documentation."` or just `git commit`
    - or any other series of changes
  - `git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME`: if you try pushing without
    setting upstream, it'll tell you do git gud and do this
  - Now create a pull request (PR) from your branch to the `dev` branch on Github
    - When the `dev` branch is tested and stable, a member of root staff will
      merge it with `prod` and deploy it on the CSUA server

## Setup Dev Site on Local Machine

- Install the latest version of Node and NPM (currently Node 8)
  - On Debian/Ubuntu, set up the Node 8 PPA with
    `curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -` followed by
    `sudo apt-get install nodejs` to actually install Node and NPM
  - Or just download the latest binaries from Node's website
- Navigate to project directory
- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js` will bundle together website assets
  to be deployed
  - Adding the watch `-w` flag to that command lets you run it as a background
    service to regenerate the `deploy/` folder when any files are changed
- `node deploy/testServerBundle`

## Source Tree

- `deploy/` - generated by running webpack `node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js`
  - `serverBundle.js` - run with node for production server
  - `testServerBundle.js` - run with node for dev server
- `node_modules/` - all the node dependencies https://i.redd.it/tfugj4n3l6ez.png
- `public/` - (compiled) static assets for the site
- `src/` - all the source code and logic for the app
  - `Pages/` - the different pages of the React app
    - `Officers/` - contains the jsx to render the officer page
      - `_OfficerCreator.jsx` - turns officer data into the pretty cards with
        officer faces
      - `Officers.jsx` - the skeleton around the officer cards
    - `Pages.jsx` - Routing info on how pages are displayed (What's the
      difference between this and `static/structure/`)
  - `App.jsx` - main app javascript logic
  - `ClientApp.js` - nests <App> into <div id="app">
  - `index.html` - the root of it all
- `static/` - configs for data on the site
  - `data/` - edit the files in here to change the data displayed on site
  - `structure/` - this contains the urls and routes for the React app
- `package.json` - lists all the necessary dependencies to be installed with
  `npm install`
- `server.js` - connect to this server with UNIX sockets
- `sslServer.js` - isn't used anymore, but this code runs the site on HTTPS
- `testServer.js` - gets compiled to deploy/ but edit this file to specify what
  port this opens the local server on
- `webpack.config.js` - details how webpack should compile assets

## Root Staff Guide (Deploying/Systems)

- This repo is located in `/webserver/csua-website` on production
  (`services.csua.berkeley.edu`)
- There are two systemd services that make this work, both in
  `/etc/systemd/system` (the files in this repo are just copies)
  - `csua-website.service`: Runs the node server as root, which binds to
    `/run/node/node.sock`
  - `csua-website-webpack.service`: Runs webpack in watch mode, which is used
    to update the resources and bundle files with zero downtime (supposedly)
- Requests to `https://www.csua.berkeley.edu` are ProxyPass'ed by Apache to this
  server
- Apache config is in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/csua-website.conf`
- Check on status using some of these commands:
  - `sudo systemctl status csua-website`
  - `sudo systemctl status csua-website-webpack`
  - `sudo journalctl -u csua-website`
    - Press "G" to go to the bottom
  - `sudo journalctl -u csua-website-webpack`
